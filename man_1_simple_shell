SIMPLE SHELL MAN

NAME
       Simple shell - hsh

COMPILING
       gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

EXECUTING
       ./hsh
SYNOPSIS
       Nax$ [command_name] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       The hsh is our implementation of a command interpreter that executes
			 different commands read from the standard input.
			 Our shell is based on the original UNIX shell written by Ken Thompson.

OPTIONS
       exit - allows you to exit the shell.
       env - environmental variables are listed.

USAGE
       hsh shell can be run in two different ways, the interactive mode where "Nax$" will appear for
			 the user to execute a command and this will be repeated until we end the hsh process 
			 using exit or ctrl + d, or there is also the non interactive mode where you can send the output 
			 of a command as an input to the ./hsh program with the pipe command.

EXAMPLE
       Interactive mode
												./hsh
       									Nax$ ls
       This will show you the list of files or directories that you have in your current directory.

       Non interactive mode
       								  echo "ls" | ./hsh
       This will show you the list of files or directories that you have in your current directory
		   in a non interactive way.
