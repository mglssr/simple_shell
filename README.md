# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system.
	- Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie led the team of computer scientists that created the first version of UNIX in 1969.

- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell.
	-	The first Unix shell was the Thompson shell, sh, written by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs and distributed with Versions 1 through 6 of Unix, from 1971 to 1975.

- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language).
	- Ken Thompson.

- Who is Ken Thompson.
	- Kenneth Lane Thompson (born February 4, 1943) is an American pioneer of computer science. Thompson worked at Bell Labs for most of his career where he designed and implemented the original Unix operating system.

- How does a shell work.
	- In general terms, a shell corresponds in the computer world to a command interpreter where the user has an available interface (CLI, Command-Line Interface), through which he has the possibility of accessing services of the operating system as well as executing or invoking programs.

- What is a pid and a ppid
	- PID stands for Process ID, Which means Identification Number for currently running process in Memory.
	- PPID stands for Parent Process ID, Which means Parent Process is the responsible for creating the current process(Child Process). Through Parent Process, The child process will be created. If you kill the parent process, the child process is also killed as well.

- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
	- 
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of `main`
- How does the shell use the `PATH` to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the `execve` system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is `EOF` / “end-of-file”?


# Things that we need on our readme

[README.md] Does the Readme have a valid title:

There is a title AND
The title makes sense

[README.md] Does the readme have a valid description of the shell? What it does and how to use it?

[README.md] Does the readme show at least one example on how to use the shell?
